It should be perceived as a natural cultural expression of Portuguese prototype. Its foundations trace back to a legacy from history, a cultural and technological medley of Roman and Arab construction that finally took hold in Portugal in the XV century during the reign of D. Jo\u00e3o II.\n\nMan, laid out his destiny by taking to the road. Step by step, hand in hand, he metamorphosed the walk and conceived the pavement. Through pavements, peoples and civilizations were united, conquests anticipated, and routes and riches found. Today, this art, so typically Portuguese, may be found in many parts of the world. \n\nEach locality takes advantage of its rich natural geological resources and uses primarily the region\u2019s prevailing stone. This is the case in Algarve with the marble and schist and the islands (Azores and Madeira Archipelagos) with the black basalt.\nIn most municipalities in recent years, the Portuguese cobblestone pavement was used as one of the requirements for urban designation.\nSponsored by: Portuguese Heritage Society of California.\n\nOpening Reception: Saturday, December 2nd, 2:00 PM; 2nd floor room 225.

Today this gallery is much as it was when Nauman installed his V-shaped corridor in its far corner, and viewers will have the unique opportunity to experience this artwork as the artist first conceived it.\n\n\nInterviews, installation photographs, and drawings provide information about the somatic experience this installation makes possible. In a video interview with Nauman conducted by Willoughby Sharp on-site in 1970 a number of mysterious reflections are discussed occurring inside the corridor. Yet, what exactly a viewer sees and experiences in the corridor remains uncertain, even today. While these questions may be answered once the work is built and placed in the gallery we also know that a reinstallation is never the same. Nor did Nauman intend the first instantiation of this corridor to be the &ldquo;original.&rdquo; It is this variability in the face of the curatorial team&rsquo;s desire to install this corridor as intended that makes this an exciting and uncertain enterprise.\n\n\nA virtual reality corridor will also be installed in an adjacent gallery, the Theta Belcher Gallery, providing a contemporary rendering of the corridor in the language of digital media. The construction of a VR corridor is testament to the changes that have occurred in the San Jos&eacute; area. While little has changed in the gallery, everything has changed around it. The city of San Jos&eacute; has grown exponentially; San Jos&eacute; College is now a University; the art department gallery is endowed; and installation art&mdash;of which Nauman is a pioneer&mdash;has developed into a recognized art practice. The erection of this corridor in 2018 speaks to these changes, as well as the role of public education in the development of installation art and the influence of Silicon Valley. The exhibition &ldquo;Time Tunnel: Bruce Nauman&rsquo;s Corridor Installation with Mirror - San Jose Installation&rdquo; delineates our relationship to time and place in these and other ways. This is its lure at least. It invites us to enter the corridor and look back at ourselves looking.\n\n\nIn conjunction with the opening of this exhibition, a panel composed of the curatorial team will be held in Art #133 on January 30, 5:00pm-6:00pm. This panel and the following opening reception, held immediately afterward in the Natalie and James Thompson Art Gallery 6:00pm-7:30pm, are free and open to the public.\nBruce Nauman's Corridor Installation with Mirror - San Jose Installation (Double Wedge Corridor with Mirror) is on loan from the Solomon R.

Sixty Published Papers from Thirteen Journals Say &ldquo;Often Not&rdquo;\n(Co-authors: Andrew C.

Defining replication success as our ability to use the author-provided data and code files to produce the key qualitative conclusions of the original paper, we successfully replicated 22 of 67 papers. Because we were able to replicate less than half of the papers in our sample even with help from the authors, we assert that economics research is often not replicable. We conclude with recommendations on improving replication of economics research.", "contactName": "Colleen Haight, PhD", "contactPhone": "408-924-5400", "categorization": "Campus Events,Community Engagement,Faculty/Staff,Lectures/Seminars,Students", "location": "SJSU Main Campus", "building": "Instructional Resource Center", "room": "101", "startDate": "2/8/2018"}, {"eventName": "The Center for Literary Arts Presents Natalie Baszile", "eventDescription": "Natalie Baszile &nbsp;- Reading &amp; Conversation&nbsp;with Selena Anderson.\n\nNatalie Baszile&nbsp;is the author of the Southern debut novel&nbsp;Queen Sugar,&nbsp;which has been adapted for television by writer/director&nbsp;Ava DuVernay and co-produced by Oprah Winfrey.Queen Sugar&nbsp;was named one of the&nbsp;San Francisco Chronicles&rsquo; Best Books of 2014 and nominated for the NAACP Image Award.

However, educators\u2019 presentation of critical thinking is uncritical and biased. The beginning of the modern university overlaps with massive periods of European colonization in different countries. The standard model of critical thinking used primarily during these time periods, and even now, derives primarily from Aristotle. One consequence is that it leaves people with the impression that critical thinking is a non-scientifically-based approach to better reasoning that derives from the west. However, there are numerous contributions to critical thinking that derive from non-western traditions. In this presentation, Dr. Vaidya offers some examples and arguments for including ideas from Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism into contemporary critical thinking education. He ties these ideas to research in cognitive science and philosophy of science.\n\nDr. Vaidya is a Professor of Philosophy in the College of Humanities and the Arts and the Director of the Center for Comparative Philosophy.\n\nThis event is a part of the University Scholar Series.

This work is an astonishingly timely narrative that explores fundamental questions about the limits of science, the ethics embedded within pushing forward with new technologies, and the relationship between and danger of trying to control the natural world. It also has an immense legacy in film and other forms. Additionally, while Mary Shelley is not the first English woman to publish, she is one of the most lauded women writers of the early 19th century.\nWith an introduction by Dean Shannon Miller to this opening event for the year, Professor Peel\u2019s lecture will be the first event to kick off the celebration spanning Spring and Fall 2018 semesters. Our goal is to not only highlight the novel itself but also to incorporate many academic disciplines into the celebration in an effort to bring interdisciplinary thought to the conversation of a novel that, even after two hundred years remains popular and culturally relevant. \nReflecting on the origin of Frankenstein, Mary Shelley later wrote that she was often asked \"how I, then a young girl, came to think of . . . so very hideous an idea.\"  We will attempt to answer that question by looking at cultural and scientific forces in her day, and by considering her early life--which itself could be a Gothic tale.

In these cases, the constraints of geometries or perspective that would feature in site or floor plans, elevations, cross-sections, and axonometric projections \u2013 let alone the technical requirements of the materials themselves \u2013 hold less sway. The imagination can run more freely if the two-dimensional image is not intended to serve as a blueprint that crystallizes design concepts into a coherent and buildable structure. \n\nThis exhibition brings together the work of five artists, each with significantly distinct aims yet whose creative expressions nonetheless are unified by their architectural references. Four have had little if any expectation that their fantastical designs would actually be constructed; the fifth is a photographer who has spent years documenting the built environments of self-taught artist-architects. \n\nThey include Alexander Brodsky and Ilya Utkin (both born 1955, Moscow), who in the eighties and early nineties collaborated on the production of an elaborate series of fantastical drawings of structures that they knew would never be built, blurring the line between art and architecture; Olalekan Jeyifous (b. 1977), a Nigerian-born, Brooklyn-based artist, who has been inspired by the existing cityscapes of his homeland to reimagine them in ways that address real challenges of housing, transportation, and delivery of resources; Achilles G. Rizzoli (1896 \u2013 1981), son of poor Italian immigrants, who was inspired by the grandiosity of San Francisco\u2019s 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition to create a utopian new world, designed in grand Beaux-Arts style; and Fred Scruton (b. 1956), professor of photography at Edinboro University in Pennsylvania, whose images of American art environments \u2013 architectural structures created over a period of decades without preconceived plans or preliminary maquettes \u2013 reveal the profundity of his own artistic engagement with the work of these self-taught artist-builders.\n\nArtist Talk with Olalekan Jeyifous and Fred Scruton, 5-6pm, March 6, 2018.\n\nOpening Reception, 6-7:30pm, March 6, 2018.\n\nGallery Viewing Hours:\n10am-4pm, Monday to Friday, and Tuesday evenings 6-7:30pm\nOn view through April 6, 2019 \n\nNatalie & James Thompson Art Gallery, Art Building #127\n\nAll events and exhibitions are open to the public free of charge.\n\nMore information at GALLERY.SJSU.EDU", "contactName": "SJSU Art Gallery Office", "contactPhone": "408.924.4330", "categorization": "Arts/Culture", "startDate": "3/6/2018"}, {"eventName": "Textbook Affordability Week #textbookbroke", "eventDescription": "# textbookbroke, Share your story about the importance of textbook affordability.", "contactName": "Jenifer Vang", "contactPhone": "408-808-2098", "categorization": "King Library", "location": "SJSU Main Campus", "building": "King Library ", "room": "4th Floor", "startDate": "3/6/2018"}, {"eventName": "Canvas Advanced: Piazza", "eventDescription": "Piazza is a wiki-style platform that goes far beyond the Canvas discussion tool!

These narratives often explore comprehensive constructions of urban utopias and dystopias that deal with the interstices of architecture, emerging technologies, and culture, anchoring them with a direct relevance to contemporary social issues in ways that communicate their participation in and alienation from the larger world.

Pesticides like atrazine are ubiquitous,&nbsp;persistent contaminants and, though more pronounced in amphibians, the effects&nbsp;described above occur in all vertebrate classes (fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals)&nbsp;examined, via common mechanisms.\n\nThese observations demonstrate the critical impact&nbsp;that pesticides have on environmental health.Reproductive cancers and&nbsp;birth defects associated with exposure to many of these chemicals (e.g. atrazine) via&nbsp;identical mechanisms demonstrate that the impact on environmental health is an indicator&nbsp;of a negative impact on public health. Many of these mechanisms are being revealed&nbsp;only now in the scientific literature and agencies are just now beginning to deal with this&nbsp;emergent science and translate it efficiently into health-protective policies. In particular,&nbsp;ethnic minorities and lower socio-economic communities are at risk: More likely to live&nbsp;in contaminated communities, work in occupations that increase hazard exposure and less&nbsp;likely to have educational and healthcare access.\n\nGiven the importance of this science and&nbsp;relevance to public health, there is a strong need to translate this information and provide&nbsp;public access to this knowledge. Command of the science and active involvement by&nbsp;the public in policy decisions is vital. Accurate information and public dissemination is&nbsp;especially important in light of evidence showing the manufacturer&rsquo;s attempts to cover up&nbsp;information and discredit scientists.", "contactName": "Michael Sneary", "contactPhone": "924-4854", "categorization": "Campus Events,Campus Events,Diversity,Diversity,Faculty/Staff,Faculty/Staff,King Library,King Library,Lectures/Seminars,Lectures/Seminars", "location": "SJSU Main Campus", "building": "King Library ", "room": "225", "startDate": "4/5/2018"}, {"eventName": "Department of Biological Sciences Grilione Seminar", "eventDescription": "\"From Silent Spring to Silent Night: A Tale of Toads and Men\" by Dr. Tyrone Hayes, Professor of Integrative Biology\nUniversity of California, Berkeley", "contactName": "Leslee Parr", "contactPhone": "408-924-4807", "categorization": "College of Science,College of Science,College of Science-Biological Sciences,College of Science-Biological Sciences", "location": "SJSU Main Campus", "building": "King Library ", "startDate": "4/5/2018"}, {"eventName": "Dept of Biological Sciences Grilione Seminar", "eventDescription": "\"From Silent Spring to Silent Night: A Tale of Toads and Men\" by Dr. Tyrone Hayes, Professor of Integrative Biology, UC Berkeley.\nReception at 3pm.", "contactName": "Michael Sneary", "contactPhone": "408-924-4885", "categorization": "College of Science-Biological Sciences,College of Science-Biological Sciences,Lectures/Seminars,Lectures/Seminars", "location": "SJSU Main Campus", "building": "King Library ", "startDate": "4/5/2018"}, {"eventName": "Beyond Containers - AppOrbit & Tech Friends at the Tech Museum", "eventDescription": "Come learn about new technologies beyond containers, making applications cloud fluent, freeing applications from development lock-in, and enabling cloud independence and portability for total cost control and management flexibility.

For decades, the immense economic, political, and cultural power of Silicon Valley has gone largely unquestioned, but is it the answer to humanity\u2019s problems or a threat to humanity as we know it? \n\nOften, the Humanities and Arts are reduced to \u201csoft skills,\u201d \u201cbusiness ethics\u201d and \u201cproduct design\u201d while humanistic traditions of creativity and contemplation are appropriated to boost productivity and profit. But as technology changes what it means and how it means to be human, we need to redefine H&A\u2019s relationship to tech and integrate/embed the Humanities/Arts deeply into every aspect of tech.  Paralleling the notion of deep learning in computer science, the concept of Deep Humanities deals with the deep structures of culture, communication, and interpretation, networks of affect, belief and bias, representations of cognition and consciousness, as well as theoretical models of ethics, aesthetics, and humanism.  As such, \u201cDeep Humanities and Deep Arts\u201d aims to bring our cumulative accumulated knowledge about the practice of being human to engage the urgent issues raised by emerging technologies and the tech industry.  \n\nJoin us for two panel discussions, filled with ethicists, scientists, a New York Times Bestselling author, and many others.
